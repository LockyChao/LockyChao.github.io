Traditional teaching methods are faced up with multiple difficulties. First, an expert is necessary for demonstration and the effect of teaching heavly depends on his knowledge. Second, conventional teaching always neglect the transmission of semantic information and the relation between different sensory information. Hence a novel natural teaching paradigm based on scene-motion cross-modal perception is proposed. Natural teaching is actually a branch of human-robot interaction (HRI) technology, representing a kind of teaching paradigm which is user-friendly and coordinates human and robot in scene comprehension. Aimed at completing tasks with specified human semantic information, natural teaching is an end-to-end and highly efficient method for interaction with surroundings or performing complicated movements. Fig.1 shows the setup of the life-sized humanoid. Fig.2 and Fig.3 presents the scene-motion perception framework and the control scheme, respectively.

With the proposed paradigm, experimentations are performed on the humanoid to verify its oustanding characteristics, including being real-time, high-accuracy, repeatability and dexterity. Fig.4 shows one of the experiments. Fig.5 displays the the human motion imitation on the humanoid.
