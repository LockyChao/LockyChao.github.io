Traditional teaching methods are faced up with multiple difficulties. For example, they always neglect the transmission of semantic information and the relation between different sensory information. Hence a novel natural teaching paradigm based on scene-motion cross-modal perception is proposed. Natural teaching is actually a branch of human-robot interaction (HRI) technology, representing a kind of teaching paradigm which is user-friendly and coordinates human and robot in scene comprehension. Fig.1 shows the setup of the life-sized humanoid. Fig.2 and Fig.3 presents the scene-motion perception framework and the control scheme, respectively.

With the proposed paradigm, experimentation was performed on the humanoid to verify its oustanding characteristics, including being real-time, high-accuracy, repeatability and dexterity. Fig.4 shows one of the experiments. Fig.5 displays the the human motion imitation on the humanoid.
