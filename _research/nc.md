title: "Scalable Production of Nitrogen-doped Carbons"

Nitrogen-doped carbons (NCs) possess superior characteristics and attract interests in many fields, e.g. energy storage,
catalysis, separations etc., yet the costly preparation process mainly due to expensive N-containing precursors limits
its large-scale application. Furthermore, the low nitrogen content and the poor control of nitrogen species (i.e. pyrrolic,
pyridinic, graphitic, and oxide of nitrogen) challenge its industrialization. Hence we are looking for a facile method to prepare NCs, of which the nitrogen content can be higher (~8 wt%), also with a better control of nitrogen species.
