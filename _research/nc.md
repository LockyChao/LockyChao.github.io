Nitrogen-doped carbons (NCs) possess superior characteristics and attract interests in many fields, e.g. energy storage,
catalysis, separations etc., yet the costly preparation process mainly due to expensive N-containing precursors limits
its large-scale application. Furthermore, the low nitrogen content and the poor control of nitrogen species (i.e. pyrrolic,
pyridinic, graphitic, and oxide of nitrogen) challenge its industrialization. Hence we are looking for a facile method to prepare NCs, of which the nitrogen content can be higher (~8 wt%), also with a better control of nitrogen species.

Fig. 1 shows our facile and novel method of scalable production of NCs. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy(XPS) and Scanning Electron Microscope(SEM) are adopted to characterize the samples. The results are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.

Currently I am working on another method to further improve the nitrogen content and nitrogen species of NCs. According to Lewis acid-base theory, NCs will serve as a high-performance catalyst for hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, which is to be verified.
