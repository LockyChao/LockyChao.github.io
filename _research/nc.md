Nitrogen-doped carbons (NCs) possess superior characteristics and attract interests in many fields, e.g. energy storage,
catalysis, separations etc., yet the costly preparation process mainly due to expensive N-containing precursors limits
its large-scale application. Furthermore, the low nitrogen content and the poor control of nitrogen species (i.e. pyrrolic,
pyridinic, graphitic, and oxide of nitrogen) challenge its industrialization.
