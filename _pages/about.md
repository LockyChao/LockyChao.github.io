I am a senior undergradate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, expected to graduate in June, 2019. My major is Mechanical Engineering, with a ranking of 1/38 in major and 1/59 in program. I am currently conducting research in [Combustion and Energy Research Group](http://combustion.sjtu.edu.cn/home/) led by [Prof. Fei QI](http://combustion.sjtu.edu.cn/people/?mid=1&version=en). My research advisors are [Dr. Hao MA](http://combustion.sjtu.edu.cn/people/?mid=493&version=en) and [Prof. Fei QI](http://combustion.sjtu.edu.cn/people/?mid=1&version=en). In mid-December, I will begin my thesis on **Nanoparticles in Spray Flame** to study their formation kinetics with laser diagnostics, advised by another professor in our group, [Prof. Yi GAO](http://combustion.sjtu.edu.cn/people/?mid=540&version=en).

The man I worship most is Leonardo Da Vinci. He was not only curious about everything, but also made a great research accomplishment with his unparalleled creativity. Even today, many scholars are still influenced by his ideas. However, life is always brutal. Most people's life ends up only becoming another ordinary moment in the history of science, but I still wish I could always stay true to my determination, and hopefully, create something amazing and become another Da Vinci! :)-->

I want to further my study and pursue a Ph.D. of Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, or in other relevant departments.
