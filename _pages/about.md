I am a senior undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, expected to graduate in June, 2019. My major is Biomedical Engineering. I am currently conducting research in Institute of Medical Imaging Technology led by [Prof. Zhi-Pei Liang](https://ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile/z-liang) and [Prof. Yiping Du](http://bme.sjtu.edu.cn/En/Show?w=107&p=87&f=1262). My research advisors are [Prof. Yao Li](http://bme.sjtu.edu.cn/En/Show?w=107&p=87&f=616). I was a summer intern during July 2018 to Sept 2018 in [Zhi-Pei Liang's Group](http://mri.beckman.illinois.edu/). In February, I will begin my thesis on **Machine Learning Application to MR Spectroscopy Imaging**  advised by  [Prof. Zhi-Pei Liang](https://ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile/z-liang) in University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

The man I worship most is Leonardo Da Vinci. He was not only curious about everything, but also made a great research accomplishment with his unparalleled creativity. Even today, many scholars are still influenced by his ideas. However, life is always brutal. Most people's life ends up only becoming another ordinary moment in the history of science, but I still wish I could always stay true to my determination, and hopefully, create something amazing and become another Da Vinci! :)-->

I want to further my study and pursue a Ph.D. of Medical Imaging in Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Medical Physics or in other relevant departments.

# Research Interests
My research interest lies in Biomedical Imaging, especially MRI. More specifically, it include but not limited to:
* **State-of-art Imaging Techniques:** Pulse Sequence Design, Application to Clinical Imaging Application (Artery MRI, 4D Flow MRI,  and Cardiovascular Imaging), Parallel Imaging, Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST), etc..
* **Machine Learning Application to Medical Imaging:** Super-resolution Image Reconstruction, Pattern Recognition, Low-rank Representation, Image Denoising, Motion Correction, etc..
* **Biomarker Study for Clinical Diagnosis:** Analysis of Brain Dysfunction with Multi-modal (or Single Modality) Image, Analysis of Brain Activity with fMRI, Analysis of Brain Microstruction Alteration with Structual Data, etc..

# Self-evaluation, Pros and Cons
I am a self-motivated person. I have broad interest in many aspects of MRI. I stick to one thing when I think I really like it, but also try  my best in everything I'm supposed  to do. I am a fast learner, and really enjoy the feeling "always on the way to be stronger". However, I realize my easy feeling of "I have already understood it" is sometimes false. I feel kind of awkward when I could not answer questions to newly studied knowledges. To ameliorate the situation, I try to think more than once before talking, and make it out immediately after questions. Hopefully I will overcome this bad habit.
