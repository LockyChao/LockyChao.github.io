- Tenor, SJTU Student Choir. I was one of the core members of SJTU student choir. I've attended many a few concerts and art performances. I was honored to get the 1st prize in 5th National University art performance competition.
- My favorite pieces are [Over the Rainbow](/files/02_over_the_rainbow.mp3) and [Fa Shu Xia](/files/15_花树下.mp3).
