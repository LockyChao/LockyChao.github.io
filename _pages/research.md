# Research Experience
## New Strategy for Super-resolution in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Jan 2018 - Present
### In UIUC and SJTU, Advised by Prof. [Zhi-Pei Liang](https://ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile/z-liang)
**Keywords: MRI Image Reconstruction, Machine Learning**

The proposed super-resolution pipeline is series of strategies to tackle the ill-posed problem where high-frequency component is recovered. Convolution neural network, sparsity-based model and data consistency model is combined to achieve this process. Experiment verified proposed method was able to reconstruct MPRAGE image with 4 times down-sampled k space.
* Leveraged the power of deep learning to give a very good initial estimation of the high-resolution image given the limited low-resolution image
* Extracted and recovered novel features which existed in practical patient images, based on k-space residual and sparsity limitation
* Utilized optimization model based on data consistency to eliminate artifacts coming along with high-resolution images generated by neural network and gave final prediction

## Multi-modal Imaging Classification using Machine-learning Algorithm in Firstepisode Schizophrenia, Oct 2016 - July 2017
### In SJTU, Advised by Prof. [Yao Li](http://bme.sjtu.edu.cn/En/Show?w=107&p=87&f=616)
**Keywords: Multi-modal MRI, Machine Learning, Classification, Neuroscience**

Established a method to distinguish the health and first-episode schizophrenia (SZ) patients given multi-modal MRI data (fMRI, DTI, T1). Proposed multimodal classification method had 81.2% accuracy with 92.5% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity for SZ diagnosis. This project received an A (Top rank of the program). The full manuscript has been published in Tenth International Conference on Digital Image Processing (ICDIP 2018). Another manuscript is under review now.
* Exploited t-test analysis after data processing using FSL and other toolkits
* Utilized Sparse Coding algorithms to screen out potential features among various biomarkers
* Implemented Random Forest algorithms to estimate the potential relationship among selected features to reach an ideal group discriminating performance

## Research of Brain Microstructure Alterations for Upper-limb Amputees, July 2017 - Present
### In SJTU, Advised by [Prof. Xiaoli Guo](https://tnsre.embs.org/author/xiaoliguo/)
**Keywords: MRI, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Probabilistic Diffusion Tractography, Neuroscience**

Analyzed white matter microstructure alterations after upper-limb amputation given DTI images. One paper in preparation; Plan to submit to journal shortly **(First Author)**
* Found significant lower Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and other significant different indices in subregions of corpus callosum (CC) in patients with residual limb pain
* Implemented Probabilistic Diffusion Tractography (PDT) and found similar changes in corresponding transcallosal tracts
* Indicated interhemispheric pathways contributing to pain sensation; chronic pain were reorganized in upper limb amputees

More details will be added soonly. (Last update: 1/1/2019)

## A universal multifactorial visualized detection system
### In SJTU, Advised by [Dr. Lin He](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/faculty/academicians/he-lin/) and [Dr. Gang Ma](http://www.bio-x.cn/en/DetailResearchInfo.php?v=0&l=3&pid=3&num=3&id=109&iid=131)
**Keywords: Synthetic biology, Biological Modelling, Genetic Engineering, iGEM Gold Metal**

This project sought to transform genetically engineered *Escherichia Coli* into a visualized monitor, which could detect multiple metal ions, display the concentration as a combination of colors, and achieve quantitative measurement. While serving as **the vice leader of a research team on behalf of SJTU** (14 undergraduates majoring in Bioengineering, Bioinformatics, Biomedical Engineering and Material Science), I was in charge of the modeling work to explore the relationship between our aimed detection substances and chromoproteins. I **orally presented** our work to professional judges from all over the world and earned a **Gold Medal in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition** (top-level international competition in synthetic biology).
* Detected multiple metal ions at the same time, displaying the concentration as a combination of colors
* Achieved quantitative measurement by building models and developing mobile APP
