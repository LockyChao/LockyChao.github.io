# Research Experience
## New Strategy for Super-resolution in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Jan 2018 - Present
### In UIUC and SJTU, Advised by Prof. Zhi-Pei Liang
**Keywords: MRI Image Reconstruction, Machine Learning**

The proposed super-resolution pipeline is series of strategies to tackle the ill-posed problem where high-frequency component is recovered. Convolution neural network, sparsity-based model and data consistency model is combined to achieve this process. Experiment verified proposed method was able to reconstruct MPRAGE image with 4 times down-sampled k space.
* Leveraged the power of deep learning to give a very good initial estimation of the high-resolution image given the limited low-resolution image
* Extracted and recovered novel features which existed in practical patient images, based on k-space residual and sparsity limitation
* Utilized optimization model based on data consistency to eliminate artifacts coming along with high-resolution images generated by neural network and gave final prediction

## Multi-modal Imaging Classification using Machine-learning Algorithm in Firstepisode Schizophrenia, Oct 2016 - July 2017
### In SJTU, Advised by Prof. Yao Li
**Keywords: Multi-modal MRI, Machine Learning, Classification, Neuroscience**

Established a method to distinguish the health and first-episode schizophrenia (SZ) patients given multi-modal MRI data (fMRI, DTI, T1). Proposed multimodal classification method had 81.2% accuracy with 92.5% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity for SZ diagnosis. This project received an A (Top rank of the program); the full manuscript has been published in Tenth International Conference on Digital Image Processing (ICDIP 2018).
* Exploited t-test analysis after data processing using FSL and other toolkits
* Utilized Sparse Coding algorithms to screen out potential features among various biomarkers
* Implemented Random Forest algorithms to estimate the potential relationship among selected features to reach an ideal group discriminating performance
